## Data encryption with random effects


# Goal: obtain the number of levels of each random effect, then generate a fake column in df.
#       This step is to make sure JWAS can generate a (fake) incidence matrix with correct size.
# Note: the user must name the encrypted indidence matrix as "name_i", e.g., "batch_1", "batch_2" for "batch" with 2 levels.
